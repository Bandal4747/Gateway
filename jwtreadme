JWT VERIFICATION AT API GATEWAY — WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY DOING?
Option A: JWT verification directly at API Gateway ✅ (Recommended)
How it works

Frontend sends JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token>

API Gateway:

Verifies signature

Verifies expiry

Verifies issuer

Verifies audience / scopes

If valid → route request

If invalid → reject immediately (401)

This is what Spring does when you configure in yaml:

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://issuer.example.com


➡ No network call per request
➡ Uses public key (JWKS) cached in memory
➡ Extremely fast (microseconds)
